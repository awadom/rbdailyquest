# rbdailyquest

RB Daily Quest is a minimalist web app that generates a daily trio of a poem, short story, and essay from free, public sources. Each day is locked in and archived locally so your reading history grows over time.

## Run locally

Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser or serve the folder with any static server.

## Features

- Daily deterministic selection (new every day)
- Local archive of past days
- Shareable links per day
- Exportable archive JSON
- Direct links to trusted open sources (Poetry Foundation, Gutenberg, etc)

## Customize sources

Edit the curated lists in [app.js](app.js) to add or replace entries.
